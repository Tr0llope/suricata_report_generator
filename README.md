# suricata report generator  

The following project is a report generator for events generated by the Suricata intrusion detection system.  

## Installation
The proper functioning of the program requires the presence of Python 3 on your system.  
You can then follow these steps:  
Creation of a virtual environment  
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Installation of dependencies  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
The program takes as an argument the name of the JSON file containing the data generated by Suricata.  
JSON files are provided in the 'data' directory. However, nothing prevents you from using your own data as long as the format is respected.
```
python3 src/main.py data/eve_2023-10-31-IcedID-infection-traffic.json
```  
There is an option that allows you to generate the report directly in PDF format.  
```
python3 src/main.py data/eve_2023-10-31-IcedID-infection-traffic.json -pdf
```

## Usage
Once executed, you can read the generated report. The report file follows the following format:  
Input: filename.json Output: report_filename.rst or report_filename.pdf  
Examples are provided in the 'reports' folder.  
```
reports/
├── report_eve_2023-10-31-IcedID-infection-traffic.pdf
├── report_eve_2023-10-31-IcedID-infection-traffic.rst
├── report_eve.pdf
└── report_eve.rst
```
  
## Remarks
Depending on the content of the input, it is possible that certain fields in the report may be empty.
